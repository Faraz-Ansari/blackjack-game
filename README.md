-   If you Press Stand Button, then no more card will be given to you but dealer will get a new card (dealer will now have total 3 cards while player only have 3). It is only when you Press Stand Button, the card value will be evaluated.

-   If you Press Hit button, then one more card will be given to you and also to dealer (dealer will now have total 3 cards while player only have 3).

-   If player have closer card value than that of dealers to 21 then player wins, else dealer will win the match.

-   If total card value exceeds 21 then Player/Dealer immediately loses.
